### The Log Window

#### Level

The default level (INFO) sends a moderate amount of information on the program's progress to the terminal window. DEBUG gives more, and the other options give less.

#### Log completion times

Writes names of operations and completion times for each to the terminal window.

#### Send to log file

Information printed to the screen will also be saved in a log file in the output directory.
