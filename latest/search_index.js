Increasing numbers of connections using diagonal (eight neighbor) connections will decrease the size of landscapes that can be analyzed. Also, increasing landscape size or numbers of focal nodes will increase computation time. We anticipate future improvements will increase the program's speed. Note that due to the matrix algebra involved with solving many pairs of focal nodes, Circuitscape will run much faster when focal points (each focal node falls within only one grid cell), rather than focal regions (at least one focal node occupies multiple grid cells), are used.","category":"section"},{"location":"compute/#Important-note:-memory-limitations","page":"On Solvers and Computation Time","title":"Important note: memory limitations","text":"There are several ways to increase the solvable grid size. These include closing all other programs (especially those that require lots of RAM such as ArcGIS), setting impermeable areas of your resistance map to NODATA, using focal points instead of regions in pairwise mode, connecting cells to their four neighbors only, and not creating current maps. Also, the one-to-all and all- to-one modes typically use less memory (and run more quickly) than the pairwise mode. In particular, the all-to-one mode can be an alternative to the pairwise mode when the goal is to produce a cumulative map of important connectivity areas among multiple source/target patches. Still, coarsening your grids (using larger cell sizes) may be necessary; doing so often produces results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained with smaller cell sizes. See McRae et al. 2008 for details of effects of using coarser grids.","category":"section"},{"location":"usage/#How-Circuitscape-Works","page":"User Guide","title":"How Circuitscape Works","text":"Whatever software you use, connectivity modeling involves a great deal of research, data compilation, GIS analyses, and careful interpretation of results. Defining areas to connect, parameterizing resistance models, and other modeling decisions you will need to make are not trivial. Before diving in, we strongly recommend that users first acquaint themselves with the process and challenges of connectivity modeling by consulting published resources. Good places to start include overviews on the Corridor Design and Connecting Landscapes websites. Spear et al. (2010), Beier et al. (2011) and Zeller et al. (2012) offer helpful advice on resistance mapping and connectivity analysis in general. Before using this software, users should acquaint themselves with the use of circuit theory for modeling connectivity (summarized in McRae et al. 2008).\n\nSee the Gnarly Landscape Utilities website for tools that can help to automate resistance and core area modeling.\n\nLastly, users interested in mapping important connectivity areas may wish to consider Linkage Mapper, which maps least-cost corridors. Linkage Mapper now also hybridizes least-cost corridor modeling with Circuitscape (see the Pinchpoint Mapper tool within the Linkage Mapper toolkit). Links to other connectivity tools can be found on the Corridor Design and Connecting Landscapes websites.\n\nCircuitscape may be called through its own graphical user interface, from the Circuitscape for ArcGIS Toolbox, or from the command line. Users supply Circuitscape with resistance data and the program calculates effective resistances and/or creates maps of current flow and voltages across landscapes and networks.","category":"section"},{"location":"usage/#Two-data-types:-network-and-raster","page":"User Guide","title":"Two data types: network and raster","text":"Circuitscape reads either a network of nodes connected by links or a raster grid of resistances (Fig. 3). Links and raster cells are attributed with resistance values that reflect the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement. Networks and raster maps can be coded in resistances (with higher values denoting greater resistance to movement) or conductances (the reciprocal of resistance; higher values indicate greater ease of movement).\n\n(Image: )\n\nFig. 1. Simple illustrations of network and raster data types used by Circuitscape. The program can operate on networks of nodes (left panel) or raster grids (right panel). Raster grid cells can have any resistance value. Here, cells with zero resistance (\"short-circuit regions,\" which can be used to represent contiguous habitat patches) are shown in white, cells with a resistance of 1 are shown in gray, and a cell with infinite resistance (coded as NODATA) is shown in black.\n\nFor rasters, every grid cell with finite resistance is represented as a node in a graph, connected to either its four first-order or eight first- and second-order neighboring cells. Cells with infinite resistance (zero conductance) are dropped. Habitat patches, or collections of cells, can be assigned zero resistance (infinite conductance) using a separate \"short-circuit region\" file. These collections of cells are collapsed into a single node.\n\n(Image: )\n\nFig. 2. Raster grids are converted to electrical networks. Each cell becomes a node (represented by a dot), and adjacent cells are connected to their four or eight neighbors by resistors. Here, the two short-circuit regions have each been collapsed into a single node. The infinite resistance cell is dropped entirely from the network.","category":"section"},{"location":"usage/#Calculation-modes","page":"User Guide","title":"Calculation modes","text":"Circuitscape operates in one of four modes: pairwise, advanced, one-to-all, and all-to-one. Pairwise and advanced modes are available for both raster and network data types. The one-to-all and all-to-one modes are available for raster data only.\n\nIn the pairwise mode, connectivity is calculated between all pairs of focal nodes (points or regions between which connectivity is to be modeled) supplied to the program in a single input file. For each pair of focal nodes, one node will arbitrarily be connected to a 1-amp current source, while the other will be connected to ground. Effective resistances will be calculated iteratively between all pairs of focal nodes, and, if selected, maps of current and voltage will be produced. If there are n focal nodes, there will be n(n - 1)/2 calculations unless you're using focal points (only one cell per focal node) and not mapping currents or voltages. In the latter case, we can do it in n calculations (much faster).\n\nThe advanced mode offers much greater flexibility in defining sources and targets for current flow. The user defines any number of current sources and any number of grounds in a network or raster landscape, and these are all activated simultaneously. Sources represent points or areas from which current flows, whereas grounds represent nodes where current exits the system.\n\nSource nodes can have different strengths (i.e. inject more or less current into the network or grid), and ground nodes can be tied to ground with any resistance. Current sources and grounds are supplied in separate input files.\n\nTwo other modes are available for raster data types only. The one-to-all mode is similar to the pairwise mode, and takes the same input files. However, instead of iterating across all focal node pairs, this mode iterates across all focal nodes. In each iteration, one focal node is connected to a 1-amp current source, while all remaining focal nodes are connected to ground. If there are n focal nodes, there will be n calculations.\n\nThe all-to-one mode is similar to the one-to-all mode, and takes the same input files. However, in this mode Circuitscape connects one focal node to ground and all remaining focal nodes to 1-amp current sources. It then repeats the process for each focal node; if there are n focal nodes, there will be n calculations.\n\nCircuitscape can generate maps showing the current density and voltage at each node or cell under each configuration (and current flow for each link/resistor in networks). Additionally, Circuitscape writes a file reporting effective resistances between all pairs of focal nodes in the pairwise mode, and between each node and ground in the one-to-all mode. Resistances in the all-to-one mode are undefined, so a file is written with zeros indicating successful solves.","category":"section"},{"location":"usage/#Illustrations-of-analyses-with-network-data","page":"User Guide","title":"Illustrations of analyses with network data","text":"For network data types, any node can be connected to any other node by a resistor:\n\n(Image: )\n\nFig. 3. Example network. This network would be input as a text list specifying resistances between each pair of connected nodes (0-1, 1-2, 1-3, 2-3, and 2-4; see the Input file formats section below).\n\nFor pairwise analysis we would also supply a list of focal nodes (containing at least two node numbers, but as many as five, the number of nodes in the circuit) between which we want to perform calculations.\n\n(Image: )\n\nFig 4. In pairwise mode, Circuitscape will iterate across pairs of nodes in a focal node list. If node 0 and node 4 are in the focal node list, then one of the iterations will look like the above, with a 1 amp current source connected to one node and the other grounded. Current will flow across the network from the source to the ground. Branch currents, node currents, node voltages, and effective resistances between node pairs can be written for each iteration.\n\nMore complexity can be added by running in advanced mode, which allows any number of sources and grounds to be activated simultaneously. For example, we could modify the circuit above by adding a single, fixed source at node zero and adding multiple grounds with different resistances. Current sources and grounds are entered in separate files.\n\n(Image: )\n\n(Image: )\n\nFig. 5. In advanced mode, any node can be tied to a current source or to ground, either directly or via resistors with any value (top panel). Currents passing through all nodes and links can then be calculated (bottom panel), and voltages can be calculated at each node. Circuit above is from McRae et al. (2008).","category":"section"},{"location":"usage/#Illustrations-of-analyses-with-raster-data","page":"User Guide","title":"Illustrations of analyses with raster data","text":"(Image: )\n\nFig. 6. Example raster input files for pairwise, one-to-all, and all-to-one modes. Input files in this example include a resistance map specifying per-cell resistances or conductances, a focal node location file (with two focal regions and one focal point in this case), and an optional short-circuit region map. Focal regions and short-circuit regions represent areas with zero resistance. Cells with the same region ID are considered perfectly connected and are collapsed into a single node, even if they are not contiguous.\n\n(Image: )\n\nFig. 7. Schematic describing pairwise mode analyses that would result from the input files shown in Fig. 8. Three sets of pairwise calculations, involving focal nodes 1 and 2, nodes 1 and 3, and nodes 2 and 3, would be conducted. For each pair, one node would be connected to a 1-amp current source, and the other to ground. Note that focal region nodes become short-circuit regions when they are activated (e.g., node 1 in scenario 1), but these regions are not present when the nodes are not activated (e.g., node 1 in scenario 3).\n\n(Image: )\n\nFig. 8.

Example raster input files for advanced mode, which requires independent current source and ground files.

Infinite resistances are coded as NODATA values (see file format description in the Input file formats section below) in input resistance grids, or as zero or NODATA in input conductance grids; these are treated as complete barriers, and are disconnected from all other cells.

Each focal node should have a unique positive integer ID. Files may be text lists specifying coordinates or appropriate raster grid formats. When a grid is used, it must have the same cell size and extent as the resistance grid. The value stored in each grid cell location refers to the focal node ID. Cells that do not contain focal nodes should be coded with NODATA values. When a text list is used, the value field references the focal node ID.\n\nFor raster analyses, focal nodes may occur at points (single cells on the resistance grid) or across regions (Fig. 8). For the latter, a single ID would occupymore than one cell in a grid or more than one pair of coordinates in a text list (and falling within more than one cell in the underlying resistance grid). Cells within a single region would then be collapsed into a single node, as they are when short-circuit region files are used (see below). The difference is that a focal region will be \"burned in\" to the resistance grid only for pairwise calculations that include that focal node. As with short-circuit regions, focal regions need not be made up of contiguous cells. For large grids or large numbers of focal nodes, focal regions may require more computation time. When calculating resistances on large raster grids and not creating voltage or current maps, focal points will run much more quickly.","category":"section"},{"location":"options/#Number-of-parallel-processors-to-use","page":"Inputs, Outputs and Options","title":"Number of parallel processors to use","text":"On Mac OS X and Linux systems, Circuitscape can run iterations in parallel for pairwise mode when focal points, not focal regions, are used.

To specify a network of resistors, three columns are used. The first and second columns give the node IDs being connected by a resistor, and the third column gives the resistance value. For example, the simple circuit:\n\n(Image: )\n\ncan be defined by the following text list:\n\n    0    1    1\n    1    2    1\n    1    3    1\n    2    4    1\n    3    4    1\n\nPlease note: typically, there should just be one entry for each pair of connected nodes. If there are two entries for a single pair in the form of (node1, node2, value1) and (node2, node1, value2), these will be considered parallel resistors and their conductances will be summed. For example, if the above text list had an extra entry for node pair (4, 3) like this:\n\n    0    1    1\n    1    2    1\n    1    3    1\n    2    4    1\n    3    4    1\n    4    3    1\n\nthen the resistance between nodes 3 and 4 in the resulting graph would be 1/2 ohm.\n\nFor advanced mode, current sources and grounds are also stored as text lists. The above circuit can be expanded to include a current source and grounds with two extra input files. For example, we can add a 1 Amp current source at node 0 with a file that looks like this:\n\n    0    1\n\nTo tie node 4 directly to ground (i.e. to connect it to ground with a wire that has a resistance of 0 Ohms) and connect the remaining nodes to ground with resistors, we can use a file that looks like this:\n\n    0    99\n    1    33\n    2    49.5\n    3    49.5\n    4    0\n\nThe resulting circuit would look like this (from McRae et al. 2008):\n\n(Image: )\n\nFor raster operations, you can also store focal nodes, current sources, and grounds as text lists (saved with a \".txt\" extension). For each node referenced in a text list, a value and X and Y coordinates are specified as shown below.\n\n    Value1 X1 Y1\n    Value2 X2 Y2\n    …\n\nNote: X and Y are geographical coordinates, not row and column numbers.\n\nExample text list (a partial list of the cell locations in the focal region map above; coordinates are for cell centroids):\n\n    1    2.5    9.5\n    1    3.5    9.5\n    1    2.5    8.5\n    1    3.5    8.5\n    1    2.5    7.5  \n    1    3.5    7.5\n    1    2.5    5.5\n    2    6.5    4.5\n    ...\n\nFor focal nodes, the value field references the focal node ID; values must be positive integers, and a single ID can occupy more than one pair of coordinates (and more than one cell in the underlying resistance grid). For current sources, the value field references the source strength in amps. For grounds, the value field references either the resistance or conductance of the resistor tying each ground node to ground, as set in the Options window.","category":"section"},{"location":"options/#Include/exclude-file-format","page":"Inputs, Outputs and Options","title":"Include/exclude file format","text":"This file will be loaded when the 'Read file with focal node pairs to include/exclude' option is checked, and affects all modes except the advanced mode. There are two file formats that can be used. The first is the simplest, and gives a list of pairs to include in calculations, or pairs to exclude, as specified in the first line of the file. For example, if there are five focal nodes, numbered 1-5, and the following list is entered, only pairs (1,2), (1,3), and (1,5) will be analyzed:\n\nmode    include\n1        2\n1        3\n1        5\n\nSimilarly, if the first line in the above file read:\n\nmode     exclude\n\nall pairs except (1,2), (1,3), and (1,5) would be analyzed.\n\nThe second method uses a matrix identifying which pairs of focal nodes to connect. The file specifies minimum and maximum values in the matrix to consider a pair connected. This method can be useful when used with a distance matrix to only run analyses between points separated by a minimum distance, or by a distance equal to or less than a maximum distance. Note: any focal node not in the matrix will be dropped from analyses. Entries on the diagonal are ignored. For example, in the following matrix, only pairs with entries between 2 and 50 are connected. Pairs (1,2), (2,4), and (3,4) will not be analyzed.

Its most common applications include modeling movement and gene flow of plants and animals, as well as identifying areas important for connectivity  conservation. Circuit theory complements commonly-used connectivity models because of its  connections to random walk theory and its ability to simultaneously evaluate contributions  of multiple dispersal pathways. Landscapes are represented as conductive surfaces, with  low resistances assigned to landscape features types that are most permeable to movement  or best promote gene flow, and high resistances assigned to movement barriers. Effective  resistances, current flow, and voltages calculated across the landscapes can then be  related to ecological processes, such as individual movement and gene flow.\n\nMore detail about the underlying model, its parameterization, and potential applications  in ecology, evolution, and conservation planning can be found in McRae (2006) and  McRae et al.
