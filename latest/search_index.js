Increasing numbers of connections using diagonal (eight neighbor) connections will decrease the size of landscapes that can be analyzed. Also, increasing landscape size or numbers of focal nodes will increase computation time. We anticipate future improvements will increase the program's speed. Note that due to the matrix algebra involved with solving many pairs of focal nodes, Circuitscape will run much faster when focal points (each focal node falls within only one grid cell), rather than focal regions (at least one focal node occupies multiple grid cells), are used.","category":"page"},{"location":"compute/#Important-note:-memory-limitations","page":"On Solvers and Computation Time","title":"Important note: memory limitations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"compute/","page":"On Solvers and Computation Time","title":"On Solvers and Computation Time","text":"Insufficient RAM is the most common cause of program errors. 32-bit systems will be particularly limited because no more than 2GB of memory can be addressed by any one process, limiting solvable landscapes to approximately 2-6 million cells, depending on the properties of the grid. Larger grids can be solved on 64-bit systems with large amounts of RAM.","category":"page"},{"location":"compute/","page":"On Solvers and Computation Time","title":"On Solvers and Computation Time","text":"There are several ways to increase the solvable grid size. These include closing all other programs (especially those that require lots of RAM such as ArcGIS), setting impermeable areas of your resistance map to NODATA, using focal points instead of regions in pairwise mode, connecting cells to their four neighbors only, and not creating current maps. Also, the one-to-all and all- to-one modes typically use less memory (and run more quickly) than the pairwise mode. In particular, the all-to-one mode can be an alternative to the pairwise mode when the goal is to produce a cumulative map of important connectivity areas among multiple source/target patches. Still, coarsening your grids (using larger cell sizes) may be necessary; doing so often produces results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained with smaller cell sizes. See McRae et al. 2008 for details of effects of using coarser grids.","category":"page"},{"location":"usage/#How-Circuitscape-Works","page":"User Guide","title":"How Circuitscape Works","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"usage/","page":"User Guide","title":"User Guide","text":"Whatever software you use, connectivity modeling involves a great deal of research, data compilation, GIS analyses, and careful interpretation of results. Defining areas to connect, parameterizing resistance models, and other modeling decisions you will need to make are not trivial. Before diving in, we strongly recommend that users first acquaint themselves with the process and challenges of connectivity modeling by consulting published resources. Good places to start include overviews on the Corridor Design and Connecting Landscapes websites. Spear et al. (2010), Beier et al. (2011) and Zeller et al.

Landscapes are represented as conductive surfaces, with  low resistances assigned to landscape features types that are most permeable to movement  or best promote gene flow, and high resistances assigned to movement barriers.
